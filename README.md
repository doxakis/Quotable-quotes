# Quotable quotes

> @CodeWisdom: "Debugging is like being the detective in a crime movie where you are also the murderer." - Filipe Fortes

> Irony: the automatic update mechanism for distributing software upgrades, the number one hope for quickly propagating security fixes, is also one giant gaping maw of a security risk. Chinese hackers 'built back door hack into software to spy on Britain’s top businesses: A legitimate software update from NetSarang was highjacked by the hackers in a “supply chain” attack...Companies at risk from this latest attack include American weapons firm Lockheed Martin, Russian energy supplier Gazprom and French bank Société Générale.

> This is a huge downside, but AWS really should detect infinite loops. Serverless: A lesson learned. The hard way: The actual cost is now $206 and over $1000 forecasted, it makes me think twice about using pay-per-use services in the future. One little mistake can cost a lot of money, the budget notifications were very late so there was very little I could do against it...This is probably the most stupid thing I ever did. One missing return; ended up costing me $206.

> nameless912~ As a developer at a company that's trying to shove Lambda down our throats for EVERYTHING...AWS needs to get better at a few key things before Lambda/serverless become viable enough that I'll actually consider integrating them into my services: 1. Permissions are a nightmare. 2. Networking is equally nightmarish. 3. If the future of compute is serverless, then Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, and whatever half-baked monstrosity Azure has cooked up are going to have to get together and define a common runtime for these environments.

> @bridgetkromhout: Thought experiment: what if all your systems restart at once? How long does it take you to recover? *Can* you? @whereistanya #velocityconf

> @slightlylate: So true. I'll trade 10 devs who are high on abstractions and metaprogramming for one who gives a damn about the user.

> Linus Torvalds: I think somebody inside of Intel needs to really take a long hard look at their CPU's, and actually admit that they have issues instead of writing PR blurbs that say that everything works as designed.

> @mikegelhar: This quote is gold "Most benchmarks represent the first date experience not the marriage experience"

> @bitfield: This isn't a patch, this is like cutting your leg off to prevent someone stealing your toes.

> @bascule: It's 2032: the Internet now runs at dialup speeds because the rest of the bandwidth is used for blockchains. We've gone back to candles because electricity that was used for lighting is now used for mining. 2D gaming is back in because GPUs are too expensive.

> @bascule: BitGrail lost $170 million worth of Nano XRB tokens because... the checks for whether you had a sufficient balance to withdraw were only implemented as client-side JavaScript

> Smári McCarthy: We [Iceland] are spending tens or maybe hundreds of megawatts on producing something [bitcoin] that has no tangible existence and no real use for humans outside the realm of financial speculation. That can't be good.

> Steve Jobs: Everything in this world... was created by people no smarter than you.

> @brettberson: I just learned from a former longtime Amazon employee, the idea for Prime came from an IC [individual contributor] engineer. He wrote up a 6 page memo. He was inspired by the Costco membership model. It was built as a test. It's now the key pillar of Amazon. The best ideas can come from anywhere.

> @geofft: At which point Trustico's CEO decided to EMAIL 23,000 CUSTOMER PRIVATE KEYS to Digicert, apparently in order to trigger that clause.

> @sama: I wonder how much cryptocurrency is slowing the rate of AI progress by wildly driving up the price of GPUs...

> @ykanellopoulos: "You can use an eraser on the table or a sledgehammer in the construction site". So much for finding bugs in production and not during design or even development.  Quote from the architect Frank Lloyd Wright brought up by @r0ml in #OReillySACon.

> @mokargas: Over a time-span of say, 4 years, any sizeable company will have projects using Grunt, Gulp, Webpack, NPM vanilla or some combination of those. Fire up any sort of legacy project, let's say, a year old, and it won't work. Require hours of troubleshooting.

> @marcoarment: I wonder how many iOS apps are secretly burning their users’ CPUs and batteries to mine Bitcoin as a revenue stream. Whatever the number is, I bet it gets much higher this year as developers and ad networks get more desperate and it becomes “standard” practice to ad-tech people.

> @CubanAnalyst: Generally this is how new ideas form in companies. It's not the CEOs or major shareholders who come up with new business dev/product/process ideas. It's usually the employees who come up with the ideas & of course implement them. Another reason why worker cooperatives make sense.

> Swizec Teller: The correct response to “How do I scale my app?” is to wait and see and monitor. Your app will tell you where it hurts. Listen. Then fix.

> @ValaAfshar: Jeff Bezos, CEO @amazon: I very frequently get the question: "what's going to change in the next 10 years?" I almost never get the question: "what's not going to change in the next 10 years?" I submit to you that the second question is actually the more important of the two.

> @danluu: A creator of the C++ STL says they might've used more cache-friendly data structures if HP Labs had the budget to buy HP PA-RISC machines?

> zie: In other words, put your documentation tools right alongside your normal workflow, so you have a decent chance of actually using it, keeping it up to date, and having others on your team(s) also use it. We put our docs in the repo's right alongside the code that manages the infrastructure.. in plain text. It's versioned. We don't publish it anywhere, it's just in the repo, but then we spend most of our time in editors messing in that repo.

> Joel Hruska: In all cases, the pirated version of the [Final Fantasy XV] was faster, by 5 percent to a whopping 33 percent, depending on the scene...The implications of these findings are straightforward: The piracy protections baked into the game are hitting overall performance, causing a significant set of issues. Companies regularly deny it happens, but tests like this punch holes in such claims.

> John Allspaw: The increasing significance of our systems, the increasing potential for economic, political, and human damage when they don’t work properly, the proliferation of dependencies and associated uncertainty — all make me very worried. And, if you look at your own system and its problems, I think you will agree that we need to do more than just acknowledge this — we need to embrace it.

> @SwiftOnSecurity: "Hey my self-driving car stops when it sees a dog" "We don't support dogs." "What?" "We couldn't figure out how to predict where dogs are going. But don't worry, we handle it safely now." "By stopping?" "AND waiting for the dog to leave. This is all explained in the patch notes."
