# Quotable quotes

> @CodeWisdom: "Debugging is like being the detective in a crime movie where you are also the murderer." - Filipe Fortes

> Irony: the automatic update mechanism for distributing software upgrades, the number one hope for quickly propagating security fixes, is also one giant gaping maw of a security risk. Chinese hackers 'built back door hack into software to spy on Britain’s top businesses: A legitimate software update from NetSarang was highjacked by the hackers in a “supply chain” attack...Companies at risk from this latest attack include American weapons firm Lockheed Martin, Russian energy supplier Gazprom and French bank Société Générale.

> This is a huge downside, but AWS really should detect infinite loops. Serverless: A lesson learned. The hard way: The actual cost is now $206 and over $1000 forecasted, it makes me think twice about using pay-per-use services in the future. One little mistake can cost a lot of money, the budget notifications were very late so there was very little I could do against it...This is probably the most stupid thing I ever did. One missing return; ended up costing me $206.
